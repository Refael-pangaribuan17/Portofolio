                    <div class="description">
                        <b>Magic Square C Language</b>
                        <p>A Magic Square game for two players, developed in C language, is an interactive and competitive game where each player takes turns filling a 3x3 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, aiming to create a magic square. In a 3x3 magic square, the sum of each row, column, and diagonal must equal 15. The game begins with an empty grid, and players alternate selecting a number to place in an empty spot. The game ensures that each number is unique and between 1 and 9, providing input validation to prevent players from choosing a number that has already been placed or selecting an occupied spot.

                            Players are prompted to enter the number they wish to place and the grid position, and the game checks if the move is valid. The game continues until one player successfully arranges the numbers in such a way that every row, column, and diagonal sums to 15, thereby completing the magic square. At that point, the game ends, and the winner is declared. If all spots are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw. The game logic ensures smooth gameplay by managing turn-taking, checking for winning conditions, and displaying the updated grid after each move, providing an engaging challenge for both players.</p>

                    <h3>Virtualization</h3>
                    <div class="description">
                        <b>Ansible</b>
                        <p>I successfully completed a comprehensive project that integrated the use of Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Minikube to automate server configuration, streamline container setup, and manage orchestration within a simulated environment. The project began with the implementation of Ansible to automate the configuration of servers, ensuring that the underlying infrastructure was consistent and ready to support containerized applications. Using Ansible playbooks, repetitive tasks such as installing dependencies, setting up networking, and configuring environment variables were automated, saving time and reducing the risk of manual errors.

                            Next, Docker was employed to containerize applications, enabling them to run seamlessly across different environments. Custom Dockerfiles were created to package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring portability and consistency. Docker Compose was also used to define and manage multi-container applications during the development and testing phases, providing a clear and efficient workflow.
                            
                            Kubernetes was then utilized for container orchestration, allowing the deployment, scaling, and management of containers across multiple nodes in the simulated environment. With Minikube, a lightweight Kubernetes implementation, I was able to create a local development environment that mimicked real-world Kubernetes clusters. This setup included defining Kubernetes manifests for pods, services, and deployments to ensure proper resource allocation, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
                            
                            The project also focused on the seamless integration of these tools to achieve a fully automated and orchestrated pipeline. For example, Ansible playbooks were used to provision Kubernetes clusters on Minikube, while Docker images were directly integrated into Kubernetes deployments for containerized workloads. The orchestration setup ensured high availability, scalability, and ease of management, replicating real-world deployment scenarios.
                            
                            By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in automating infrastructure management, containerization, and orchestration. It highlighted the importance of combining tools like Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Minikube to build efficient, reliable, and scalable systems that can adapt to dynamic application requirements in both simulated and real-world environments.</p>

                        <b>Tic Tac Toe</b>
                        <p>A Tic Tac Toe game developed in C language is a simple but engaging implementation of the classic two-player game where players take turns placing "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game starts with an empty grid, which is represented as a 2D array in C. Each player alternates between Player 1 (who plays "X") and Player 2 (who plays "O"), choosing a number between 1 and 9 corresponding to an empty spot on the grid. The program checks if the chosen spot is available and prompts the player to choose again if the spot is already taken.

                            The game includes input validation to ensure that players enter valid numbers within the range and only choose unoccupied positions. After each move, the program updates the grid and checks whether the current player has won by achieving three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If a player achieves this, they win the game, and the program announces the winner. If all spots on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw. The program runs in a loop, continuously alternating between players and checking for winning or draw conditions until the game is over. This implementation not only provides a fun, interactive experience but also reinforces concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling in C programming.</p>
